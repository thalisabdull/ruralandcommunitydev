    <h2>Finished and Ongoing Projects:</h2>
    <p>
      The Niger State Ministry of Rural and Community Development has successfully
       completed numerous projects aimed at uplifting rural communities, including 
       the construction and rehabilitation of rural roads, establishment of primary 
       healthcare centers, and development of educational facilities. <br>
       Currently, we are actively implementing several key initiatives 
       such as expanding rural infrastructure, 
       launching youth and women empowerment programs, setting up community 
       grazing reserves, and rolling out agricultural development funds. 
       These projects are designed to foster sustainable growth, improve livelihoods, 
       and ensure inclusive development across all local government areas.
